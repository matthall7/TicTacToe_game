#Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A classic game to get started with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The HTML and CSS were not that complicated here, but the javascript made the game.
With the letters showing up slightly while hovering over a space, and the loop used to check if a player had won or not, the functions in this game helped give me an understanding as to how javascript brings functionality to a web applicaiton.
